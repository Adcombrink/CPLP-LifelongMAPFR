This is the official respository for the article **Prioritised Planning for Continuous-time Lifelong Multi-agent Pathfinding**, which describes a fast, sub-optimal planning algorithm for collision-free movements of agents with volumes in continuous-time for the lifelong multi-agent pathfinding problem. The pre-print version is available at [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-1234.56789-B31B1B.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13175), to be submitted to [CoDiT25](https://www.codit2025.org/).
